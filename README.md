all: debug optimize

This line defines a phony target called "all," which is the default target when you run the make command without specifying a target explicitly. It depends on two other targets: "debug" and "optimize." When you run make all, it will execute both "debug" and "optimize" targets.
debug: indiamain_debug spainmain_debug

This target, "debug," depends on two other targets, "indiamain_debug" and "spainmain_debug." It is responsible for building and running the debug versions of your main programs for India and Spain.
main_debug: indiamain.cpp

This target, "main_debug," builds the debug version of the "main" program using the "g++" compiler with the "-g" flag for debugging information. It then runs the resulting executable.
spainmain_debug: spainmain.cpp

This target, "spainmain_debug," builds the debug version of the "spainmain" program using the "g++" compiler with the "-g" flag for debugging information. It then runs the resulting executable.
optimize: indiamain_optimize spainmain_optimize

This target, "optimize," depends on two other targets, "indiamain_optimize" and "spainmain_optimize." It is responsible for building optimized versions of your main programs for India and Spain.
main_optimize: main.cpp

This target, "main_optimize," builds the optimized version of the "main" program using the "g++" compiler with the "-O3" flag for maximum optimization.
spainmain_optimize: spainmain.cpp

This target, "spainmain_optimize," builds the optimized version of the "spainmain" program using the "g++" compiler with the "-O3" flag for maximum optimization.
clean:

This target, "clean," is used to remove any generated executable files. When you run make clean, it will delete the "main_debug," "main_optimize," "spainmain_debug," and "spainmain_optimize" executables, if they exist.
